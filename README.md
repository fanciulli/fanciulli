### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with 17 years of experience in development.

I'm a contributor developer of the Open Source project [Volumio](https://github.com/volumio/Volumio2), an audiophile music player for micro-computers. I've created integration services for enabling streaming services like Tidal and Qobuz into the Volumio ecosystem. Don't you know the project already? Go check it out!
