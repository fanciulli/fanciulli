### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with 18 years of experience in Software Development. 

My main focus is the development of server side solutions (APIs, processing components) in several languages, mainly Node.js and Python. Some of these have reached wide audience (thousands of active users) while some served specific, critical use cases like those developed for the Space.

I am currently in charge of defining and developing a Cloud infrastructure for Domotz Inc while previously i've been the Project Manager of the Cosmo Skymed Second Generation project for the Intecs Solutions company.

For several years i have been an active contributor to the Open Source project Volumio, an audiophile music player for micro-computers. I've created integration services for enabling streaming services like Tidal and Qobuz into the Volumio ecosystem.
